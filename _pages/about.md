### 👋🏻 I'm Aniket, a software engineer who loves to tinker.

🔨 Currently, I am working as a machine learning engineer in Accenture building a **search product for healthcare enterprises**. I am also into web development, actively learning and building apps. In the past, I have integrated features based on ML into web apps built using react. I have interests in NLP and next generation web apps.

🧬 Besides day to day work, I read a lot. Currently, I am reading 📚 Susan Cain's Quiet.

💸 I love discussing about technology, cryptocurrency and investing or any random facts.
