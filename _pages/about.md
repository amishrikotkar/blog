### 👋🏻 I'm Aniket, a software engineer who loves to tinker.

⚒ Currently, I am working as a machine learning engineer in Accenture building a search product for healthcare enterprises. I am also into web development, 
actively learning and building apps. In the past, I have integrated features based on ML into some web apps. I have interests in NLP and robotics.

🧬 Besides day to day work, I read a lot. Currently, I am reading 📚 Susan Cain's Quiet.

💸 I love discussing about technology, cryptocurrency and investing or any random facts.
