### 👋🏻 I'm Aniket, an engineer who loves to tinker.

🔨 I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Accenture. I am working on search for healthcare enterprises. I am also into web development, actively learning and building apps. In the past, I have integrated features based on ML into web apps built using react. I have interests in NLP and next generation web apps. Currently, I am learning Graph ML and its applications.

🧬 Besides day to day work, I read a lot. Currently, I am reading 📚 Susan Cain's Quiet and Andre Agassi's Open.

💸 I love discussing about technology, cryptocurrency, investing or any random facts and stories.
